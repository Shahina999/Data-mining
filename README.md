I have worked extensively on an **Online Retail Segmentation** project, showcasing my expertise in data mining, SQL, and customer analytics. I utilized SQL queries to perform customer segmentation, analyze purchasing patterns, and conduct advanced tasks like customer churn analysis, product affinity, and time-based behavior trends. This project enhanced my skills in handling large datasets, extracting valuable insights, and creating precise customer groupings for targeted marketing efforts. Additionally, I used tools like MySQL and GitHub, effectively presenting my work through detailed reports and presentations.
